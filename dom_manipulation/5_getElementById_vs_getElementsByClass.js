// Both getElementById and getElementsByClassName are methods in JavaScript used to select elements from the DOM, but they differ in how they select elements.

// getElementById method returns a single element with a specific ID that matches the provided argument.IDs are unique within a page, so the method always returns one element.This method is useful when you want to select a specific element on a page and perform an action on it.

//     Example:


// const element = document.getElementById("myElement");
// On the other hand, getElementsByClassName method returns a collection of elements that have the same class name provided in the argument.Since multiple elements can have the same class, this method returns a collection of all matching elements.This method is useful when you want to perform an action on multiple elements with the same class.

// Example:
// const elements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");

//ðŸ‘€ It's important to note that getElementsByClassName returns a live HTMLCollection, which means that if elements are added or removed from the DOM, the collection is automatically updated.

// In summary, getElementById is used to select a single element by its unique ID, while getElementsByClassName is used to select multiple elements by their shared class name.
