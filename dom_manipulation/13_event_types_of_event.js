// An event is an action or occurrence that happens in the web browser, such as a user clicking a button, hovering over an element, or a page finishing loading.Events are triggered by the user or by the browser and can be used to execute JavaScript code in response to the event.

// There are many types of events in the web, including:

// Mouse events: These events are triggered by the user interacting with the mouse, such as clicking, double - clicking, hovering over, or scrolling.

// Keyboard events: These events are triggered by the user interacting with the keyboard, such as pressing a key or releasing a key.

// Touch events: These events are triggered by the user interacting with a touch screen device, such as tapping or swiping.

// Form events: These events are triggered by the user interacting with form elements, such as submitting a form or changing the value of an input field.

// Window events: These events are triggered by the browser, such as when the page finishes loading or when the user resizes the browser window.

// Custom events: These events are created by the developer and can be triggered programmatically, allowing you to create your own custom interactions and behaviors.

// In order to handle events in JavaScript, you can use event listeners, which are functions that are executed when an event occurs.You can attach event listeners to elements using the addEventListener method, and you can specify which event to listen for and which function to execute when the event occurs.
