// querySelector and querySelectorAll are methods in JavaScript used to select elements from the DOM based on a CSS selector.They are powerful methods that allow you to select elements with great specificity and flexibility.

// querySelector returns the first element that matches the specified selector, while querySelectorAll returns a list of all elements that match the specified selector.

// Here are some examples:


 // select the first element with a class of "myClass"
// const element = document.querySelector('.myClass');


// select all elements with a class of "myClass"
// const elements = document.querySelectorAll('.myClass');


 // select the first element with an ID of "myElement" inside a div with a class of "myDiv"
// const element = document.querySelector('div.myDiv #myElement');


 // select all elements with a class of "myClass" that are descendants of a div with an ID of "myDiv"
// const elements = document.querySelectorAll('#myDiv .myClass');

 // select all elements that have a data attribute of "myData"
// const elements = document.querySelectorAll('[data-myData]');

// In these examples, the selectors used are based on CSS syntax.The first example selects the first element with a class of "myClass", while the second example selects all elements with that class. The third example selects the first element with an ID of "myElement" that is a child of a div with a class of "myDiv", while the fourth example selects all elements with a class of "myClass" that are descendants of a div with an ID of "myDiv".The fifth example selects all elements that have a data attribute of "myData".

// querySelector and querySelectorAll are very useful methods that can greatly simplify your code when you need to select elements from the DOM.
